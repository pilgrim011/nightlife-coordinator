check bars in your town
Node.js app which uses Yelp API in order to inform you about local bars. Authenticated users can add themselves by clicking the button in order to inform their friends that they will be visiting some of the bars. Proof of concept - needs additional work - storing user data in db and deleting stored data after some time (midnight?)... Will be finished later.
